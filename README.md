# Project description

A small space simulator game, powered by [bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy), with a physics-based control (no absolute velocity).

Project goals:

- Practice with Rust language.
- Do a small hobby project.
- Test how to perform docking/navigation/interception/etc. in a real space.
- Create a platform for various AI algorithms tests.
